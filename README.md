Tools for interacting with the [General Lake Model (GLM)](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/ "General Lake Model's website") in R. `glmtools` includes some basic functions for calculating physical derivatives and thermal properties of model output, and some plotting functionality (see example image below).

FAQ
===

How do I install `glmtools`? It isn't on CRAN!
==============================================

```r
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('usgs-r/glmtools')
```

What libraries does `glmtools` need?
====================================

This version requires the NetCDF version R library (called `ncdf4`), and `rLakeAnalyzer`, and `tools` if you would like to run all examples.

| package       | version     |
|:--------------|:------------|
| R             | &gt;= 3.0   |
| GLM3r          | \*          |
| rLakeAnalyzer | &gt;= 1.8.3 |
| ncdf4         | \*          |
| tools         | \*          |
| akima         | \*          |
| lazyeval      | \*          |
| methods       | \*          |

How do I contribute new code back to the glmtools project?
==========================================================

In order to contribute to this code, we recommend the following workflow:

1.  "fork" this repository to your own personal github account

2.  clone the github repository to your computer:

    $git clone <https://github.com/%7Busername%7D/glmtools.git>

3.  modify code or add new functionality, save the code

4.  add the repository master to a remote master called "upstream"

    $cd glmtools

    $git remote add upstream <https://github.com/USGS-R/glmtools.git>

5.  before pushing your changes to your repository, pull in the current version of the GLEON master:

    $git fetch upstream

6.  merge these differences with your own "master" version:

    $git merge upstream/master

7.  push your changes to your github repository, in addition to changes made by pulling in the GLEON master:

    $git push

8.  submit a pull request to GLEON master using your account at github.com
